-- touch anything except these tables — and it can't DELETE scores at all. The
-- app never deletes from the score tables; only clearing a pair draw, group draw
-- or tee choice removes a row. So a phone (or anyone with the key) can't wipe
-- the week, however hard it tries. To start fresh between trips, run this in
-- the SQL editor (the history table below keeps a copy of everything anyway):
--   truncate hole_scores, team_scores, team_drives, pair_draws, group_draws, bit_events, bonus_balls, tee_choices, stakes;
